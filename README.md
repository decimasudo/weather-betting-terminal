## 📡 The Transmission

WEATHER BETTING TERMINAL is a high-frequency interface designed for the intersection of climate data and predictive markets. It aggregates global weather telemetry into actionable betting opportunities through real-time satellite analysis and AI-driven probability modeling.

We don't just track weather. We quantify atmospheric uncertainty and map the psychological matrix of climate markets through proprietary simulation engines and sentiment analysis.
