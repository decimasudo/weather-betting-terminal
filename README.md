## 📡 The Transmission

CLIMATE INTELLIGENCE AGENT is an autonomous AI system built for the intersection of atmospheric science and predictive markets.

It transforms global climate telemetry into actionable probability signals through real-time satellite monitoring, anomaly detection, and advanced AI modeling.

We don’t just track weather.
We quantify atmospheric uncertainty — modeling volatility, detecting regime shifts, and mapping the structural dynamics of climate-driven markets through proprietary simulation engines and behavioral signal analysis.
